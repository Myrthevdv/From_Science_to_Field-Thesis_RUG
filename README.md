### The Repository
This repository consist of a the code and data used for the thesis from science to field: Leveraging an Open-Source Language Model for Tailored Summaries of Sport Science Articles for Athletes

#### Data folder
- ```Annotated data.xlsx```
    - This dataset contains 15 selected articles about "sport injuries" from PMC, including their Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion (AIC). Additionally, for each article, the dataset includes three summaries generated by three different closed-source LLMs (ChatGPT, Cohere, and Gemini). The dataset also includes annotations for each summary, which consist of the overall relative rank (1-3), the rankings (1-5) on different evaluation criteria: Clarity and Accessibility, Inclusion of Key Findings, and Relevance for Athletes and each ranking comes with explanations of the choices made for the ranking on these three evaluation criteria for each summary.
- ```Development_set.xlsx```
    - This dataset contains the last 4 articles, including rankings and explenations from the ```Annotated data.xlsx``` which is used in the development phase. 
- ``` Development_set_summaries_and_BERTScores.xlsx ```
    - This dataset contains for the first 3 summaries of the  ```Development_set.xlsx```, 3 different summaries in which these 3 summaries are used in the few-shot prompt to create a summary of the last article in the ```Development_set.xlsx```
- ```Evaluation_set.xlsx```
    - This dataset contains the first 11 articles, including rankings and explenations from the ```Annotated data.xlsx``` which is used in the evaluation phase. 
- ```Summarized_Articles_Phi3.xlsx```
    - 11 articles from the ```Evaluation_set.xlsx``` that are summarized by the open-source LLM Phi3 by the 4 different prompts
 
#### Data/evaluation_scores folder

- ```BERTScores_summarized_articles.xlsx```
      - This dataset contains the BERTScore of all the summries generated with the open-source LLM Phi3 from the evaluation set, compared with the annotated relative (rank1,rank2,rank3) summaries generated by the closed-source LLM
- ```Readability_scores_summarized_articles.xlsx```
      - This dataset contains the Flesch Reading Ease Scores and Flesch Kincaid Grade Levels
