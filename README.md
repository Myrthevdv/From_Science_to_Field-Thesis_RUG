### The Repository
This repository consist of a the code and data used for the thesis from science to field: Leveraging an Open-Source Language Model for Tailored Summaries of Sport Science Articles for Athletes

#### Data folder
- ```Annotated data.xlsx```
    - This dataset includes 15 selected articles about "sport injuries" from PMC. For each article, three summaries generated by closed-source LLMs (ChatGPT, Cohere, and Gimini) are included, along with their relative overall ranks. Additionally, the dataset includes rankings and explanations of the evaluation criteria: Clarity and Accessibility, Inclusion of Key Findings, and Relevance for Athletes for each LLM summary.
- ```Development_set.xlsx```
    - 4 articles with their corresponding rankings + explenation from the Annotated data file used in the Development phase
- ``` Development_set_summaries_and_BERTScores.xlsx ```
    - 3 summaries for the last article Patterns and Trends of Foot and Ankle Injuries in Olympic Athletes" of the ```Development_set.xlsx``` + the Bertscores of the simmilarity of the overall relative best ranked summary (below in this dataset) from the ```Annotated data.xlsx``` and the different summaries prodced by the different prompts for the last article in the ```Development_set.xlsx```
- ```Evaluation_set.xlsx```
    -   11 articles with their corresponding rankings + explenation from the Annotated data file used in the Evaluation phase
- ```Summarized_Articles_Phi3.xlsx```
    - 11 articles from the ```Evaluation_set.xlsx``` that are summarized by the open-source LLM Phi3 by the 4 different prompts
 
#### Data/evaluation_scores folder

- ```BERTScores_summarized_articles.xlsx```
      - This dataset contains the BERTScore of all the summries generated with the open-source LLM Phi3 from the evaluation set, compared with the annotated relative (rank1,rank2,rank3) summaries generated by the closed-source LLM
- ```Readability_scores_summarized_articles.xlsx```
      - This dataset contains the Flesch Reading Ease Scores and Flesch Kincaid Grade Levels
